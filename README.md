This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error related to edge case handling. The function `myFunction` calculates x^2 if x is greater than 10, and x+5 otherwise. The issue arises when x is exactly 10, as the code does not explicitly handle this scenario, leading to unexpected results. A solution is provided to demonstrate proper error handling and edge case management.
